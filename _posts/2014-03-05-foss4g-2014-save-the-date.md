Get your hack on the map this year at [FOSS4G 2014](https://2014.foss4g.org). The event runs from Sept 8th-12th in sunny* Portland Oregon. The conference is an amazing creative gathering of everything that makes open source and mapping fun. It would be great to see you there.

Last year we had a [great selection](http://blog.geoserver.org/2013/10/02/geoserver-foss4g-2013/) of GeoServer presentations. If you are interested in presenting please keep the April 15th submission deadline in mind.

_* In traditional west coast fashion Sun may be replaced with large cups of coffee_

## GeoServer Sprint Sunday Sep 14


Have you booked your flight yet? Please consider staying an extra day to enjoy the company of the geoserver-devel team on Sunday Sep 14.

The GeoServer team is looking at extended the FOSS4G code sprint by an extra day in order to get some face-2-face work done. There will be a few teams attending remotely (hi [CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au)!) so if you are unable to extend your air fair you may still be able to take part.

We would like to thank [Mike Pumphrey](http://boundlessgeo.com/team-member/mike-pumphrey/) (Boundless) for arranging a venue. We are seeking additional sponsors to cover food and activities. Please contact [Jody Garnett](http://boundlessgeo.com/team-member/jody-garnett/) if you are in position to help out.
