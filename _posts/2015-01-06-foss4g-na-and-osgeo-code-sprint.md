There are a couple of upcoming events that will be fun for all the GeoServer fans out there.


## [FOSS4G-NA](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/) (March 9-12th)


FOSS4G North America is set to be an amazing mix of open source activity. Held in San Francisco over March 9-12, the conference is co-located with [EclipseCon](https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2015/event/619) and a PostgreSQL day. Co-locating reduces the costs and provides a diverse selection of talks we do not normally get at a FOSS4G.

The [schedule](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/conference/schedule/session/2015-03-09) is up and a number of GeoServer talks have been [selected](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/program/sessions/accepted):



	
  * [Creation, Analysis, Sharing, and Visualization of Complex Spatiotemporal Data using Free and Open Source Software at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/session/creation-analysis-sharing-and-visualization-complex-spatiotemporal-data-using-free-and-open)

	
  * [Flying the Open Source Skies: GIS in Air Traffic Management](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/session/flying-open-source-skies-gis-air-traffic-management)

	
  * [GeoServer, an introduction for beginners](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/session/geoserver-introduction-beginners) (workshop)

	
  * [Hudson River Flood Decision Support Tool](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/session/hudson-river-flood-decision-support-tool)

	
  * [OSGeo and LocationTech Comparison and Incubation](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/session/osgeo-and-locationtech-comparison-and-incubation)

Keep in mind:

	
  * There are some discount codes for Committers, OSGeo Sponsors or "Alumni" that have attended FOSS4G in the past.

	
  * The early bird rate is already gone (Dec 31st) but you can still get a reduced rate before Feb 2nd

	
  * If you cannot otherwise afford to attend FOSS4G please apply for a conference grant (between Jan 7th and the 21st)

	
  * If you are feeling lucky, try the weekly-draw [contest](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/news/contest) for an All-Access pass.


The conference is a collaboration of OSGeo and LocationTech. Thanks to both organisations for supporting open source mapping.
