## Security Considerations

This release addresses security vulnerabilities and is considered an essential upgrade for production systems.

* CVE-2024-36401 Critical
* CVE-2024-34696 Moderate
* CVE-2024-35230 Moderate
* CVE-2024-24749 Moderate

The details of this vulnerability will be made available at the end of the month providing an opportunity to update.

The use of the CVE system allows the GeoServer team to reach a wider audience than blog posts. See the project [security policy](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more information on how security vulnerabilities are managed.

## Demo Requests page rewritten

The Demo Request page has been rewritten use use JavaScript to issue POST examples. This provides a much better user experience:

* **Show Result** lists the response headers to be viewed along side the returned result (with an option for XML pretty printing).
* **Show Result in a New Page** is available to allow your browser to display the result.

The **WCS Request Builder** and **WPS Request Builder** demos now have the option to show their results in Demo Requests page. Combined these changes replace the previous practice of using an iframe popup, and have allowed the **TestWfsPost** servlet to be removed.

For more information please see the [Demo requests](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/configuration/demos/index.html#demos-demorequests) in the User Guide.

Thanks to David Blasby (GeoCat) for these improvements, made on behalf of the GeoCat Live project.
