GeoServer is updating our communication channels! We know people do not like signing up for mailing lists and it is time to move on.

## GeoServer User Forum

Welcome to the [GeoServer User forum](https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/geoserver/geoserver-users):

* This forum is open to the public, we are pleased to meet you and hope you enjoy using GeoServer.
* Hosted by Open Source Geospatial Foundation
* All project communication including this forum are subject to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* This is one of many options for [community support](/comm/) and communication.

Taking part is easy (sign-in with credentials you already have):

1. Login to [discourse.osgeo.org](https://discourse.osgeo.org/):
   
   * Login "with LDAP" to use your OSGeo userID (also used for [other OSGeo services](https://www.osgeo.org/community/getting-started-osgeo/osgeo_userid/)).
   * Use "Log in with GitHub" to use GitHub credentials

2. You may also use "Sign Up" if you want to create an account just for use with the Forum.

3. Then when you are comfortable, it is time to unsubscribe to from [geoserver-users](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/lists/geoserver-users) email list.

4. We will continue to operate the geoserver-users list for the month of August,
   and then do a final synchronization of any outstanding email messages to complete the migration.

   For more information: [GSIP 225 - Migrate geoserver-users from SourceForge to Discourse](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-225).

## If you enjoy email 

If you enjoy the out-of-band timezone friendly mailing list experience - good news as Discourse allows you to subscribe to notifications, and use email to post and reply to topics.

1. Sign-in to Discourse as above.

2. Navigate to [GeoServer User](https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/geoserver/user) category, and use the bell to change notifications to **Watching**.

2. You can then join the [GeoServer Users Group](https://discourse.osgeo.org/g/geoserver-users).
