GeoServer is updating our communication channels!

We know people do not like signing up for mailing lists, Twitter has been Xed out, and it is time to move on. 
    
## GeoServer User Forum

Welcome to the [GeoServer User forum](https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/geoserver/geoserver-users):

* This forum is open to the public, we are pleased to meet you and hope you enjoy using GeoServer.
* Hosted by Open Source Geospatial Foundation
* All project communication including this forum are subject to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* This is one of many options for [community support](/comm/) and communication.

### Sign in

Taking part is easy (sign-in with credentials you already have):

1. Login to [discourse.osgeo.org](https://discourse.osgeo.org/):
   
   * Login "with LDAP" to use your OSGeo UserID (also used for [other osgeo services](https://www.osgeo.org/community/getting-started-osgeo/osgeo_userid/)).
   
     The button appears greyed out, but this is only poor styling choice.
     The button is enabled and works.
     
   * Use "Log in with GitHub" to use GitHub credentials.
   
   * More options are added over time.

2. You may also use "Sign Up" if you want to create an account just for use with the Forum.

3. Unsubscribe from [geoserver-users](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/lists/geoserver-users) email list.

   We will continue to operate the geoserver-user list for the month of August,
   and then do a final synchronization of any outstanding email messages to complete the migration.

For more information [GSIP 225 - Migrate geoserver-users from SourceForge to Discourse](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-225).

### Use as a mailing list replacement

If you enjoy the out-of-band timezone friendly mailing list experience - Discourse allows you to subscribe to notifications, and use email to post and reply to topics.

1. Sign-in to Discourse as above.

2. Navigate to [GeoSever User]() category, and use the bell to change notifications to **Watching**.
