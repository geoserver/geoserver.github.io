The GeoServer community has been under considerable strain responding to [CVE-2024-36401](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-6jj6-gm7p-fcvv). This vulnerability stems from GeoTools library [CVE-2024-36404](https://github.com/geotools/geotools/security/advisories/GHSA-w3pj-wh35-fq8w).

This vulnerability, in the handling of XPath expressions, affords a "remote code execution" attack that is under active exploit. A remote code execution (RCE) attack allows an attacker to run malicious code on your computer or network.

## Q: How often should I upgrade GeoServer?

GeoServer operates with a time boxed release cycle, maintaining "stable" and "maintenance" releases, over the course of a year.

* Upgrade GeoServer twice a year as new stable releases are made.

* Once the release you are using has entered "maintenance" it is a good idea to upgrade (before the release is no longer supported).

* GeoServer [security policy](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/SECURITY.md) provides one year of support. You may also contact our [service providers](/support/)
  for extended support beyond this timeframe.

## Q: Notification of security vulnerabilities?

Stay up to date:

1. Please monitor release announcements for the heading "Security Considerations".
     
    > **Security Considerations**
    >  
    > This release addresses security vulnerabilities and is considered an essential upgrade for production systems.
    >  
    > * CVE-2024-36401 Critical

    You can review the release announcement, and in this case with a "Critical" vulnerability decide to update.

2. When everyone has had an opportunity to update the details of the vulnerability are announced.

    > **Security Considerations**
    >  
    > This release addresses security vulnerabilities and is considered an essential upgrade for production systems.
    >  
    > * CVE-2024-36401 Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in evaluating property name expression (Critical)

3. As GeoServer has now adopted use CVEs for publication you may also have success with vulnerability scanning tools.

    <img src="/img/posts/2.26/cve-scan.png" alt="CVE Scan Results" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:80%;"/>
    
    These tools function when the vulnerability is published, and do not provide any advance notice.

## Q: Notification of security reports?

As security reports contain sensitive information they are only shared with representatives of the geoserver-security email list.

Participation in geoserver-security, like commit access, is volunteer based and reflects trust.

Please review GeoServer [Security Policy](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/developer/policies/security.html) if you are in a position to help out.
