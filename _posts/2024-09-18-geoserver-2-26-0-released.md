## Nightly build testing

This release cycle we asked our new user forum to test a nightly build, as we did not have capacity to make a release candidate.

Thanks to Daniel Calliess for responding during our public testing cycle. Daniel noted that he had to add `/geoserver/webresources` to his proxy for the OpenLayers preview to function. This change is due to an ongoing effort to move all CSS and JS to external resources allowing [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com/) headers to be introduced.

## Security Considerations

This release addresses security vulnerabilities and is a recommended upgrade for production systems.

* [CVE-2024-34711](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-mc43-4fqr-c965) Improper ENTITY_RESOLUTION_ALLOWLIST URI validation in XML Processing (SSRF) (High 7.3)
* [CVE-2024-35230](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-6pfc-w86r-54q6): Welcome and About GeoServer pages communicate version and revision information (Moderate 5.3)

See project [security policy](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more information on how security vulnerabilities are managed.

## Java 17 Support

The binary distribution and the Windows installer now work with Java 17.

When using the war distribution with Tomcat and Java 17 double check the **Server status** page.
If the **Java Rendering Engine** is listed as "Unknown", double check the [Running in Java 17](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/java.html#running-on-java-17) production considerations.

Thanks to Andrea Aime and everyone who worked on testing this in different environments.

* [GEOS-11467](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11467) Update Marlin, make the bin package compatible with Java 17

## Docker Updates

The base image `tomcat:9.0.95-jdk17-temurin-jammy` is now used - providing the latest Tomcat 9 and Java 17. The docker crew changed from using `ubuntu:22.04` with our own Tomcat install script earlier in the year.

To try out GeoServer 2.26.0 with docker:
```
docker pull docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.26.0 
docker run -it -p8080:8080 docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.26.0 
```

Thanks to Nils Bühner (terrestris) and everyone who has contributed to the Docker build.

## Search improvement

A small but fun change for the layer preview - it is now easier to find just the layer you are looking for using quotes to isolate an individual word.

Thanks to Alessandro Ricchiuti for this work.

* [GEOS-11351](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11351) Exact term search in the pages' filters

## Extensive MapML Improvements

Thanks to Natural Resources Canada for sponsoring an extensive set improvements for the [MapML extension](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/mapml/index.html).

![](/img/posts/2.26/mapml.png)

This update was carried out by a group of GeoSolutions devs, Andrea Aime, Daniele Romagnoli and Joseph Miller.

## Demo Requests page rewritten

The Demo Request page has been rewritten to use JavaScript to issue POST examples. This provides a much better user experience:

* **Show Result** lists the response headers to be viewed along side the returned result (with an option for XML pretty printing).
* **Show Result in a New Page** is available to allow your browser to display the result.

![](/img/posts/2.25/demo-request.png)

![](/img/posts/2.25/demo-response.png)

The **WCS Request Builder** and **WPS Request Builder** demos now have the option to show their results in Demo Requests page. Combined these changes replace the previous practice of using an iframe popup, and have allowed the **TestWfsPost** servlet to be removed.

For more information please see the [Demo requests](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/configuration/demos/index.html#demos-demorequests) in the User Guide.

Thanks to David Blasby (GeoCat) for these improvements, made on behalf of the GeoCat Live project.

* [GEOS-11390](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11390) Replace TestWfsPost with Javascript Demo Page

## JTS 1.20.0 Update

We are overjoyed to update to the latest [JTS 1.20.0 release](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/locationtech.jts/releases/1.20.0) which includes a new implementation of spatial relationships.

Use ``-Djts.relate=ng`` to try out the new implementation (replacing ``RelateOp`` with  the``ReleateNG`` next generation implementation). Let us know how it goes, a future update will make this setting the default and expand the approach to "prepaired geometry" bulk operations used for WFS Queries.

Thanks to Martin Davis (CrunchyDB) for the JTS improvements, and Jody Garnett (GeoCat) for the release and GeoServer update.

* [GEOS-11532](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11532) Update to JTS 1.20.0

## Raster Attribute Table Extension

A new extension is available that takes advantage of the GDAL Raster Attribute Table (RAT). This data structure provides a way to associate attribute information for individual pixel values within the raster. This provides a table that links each cell value in the raster to one or more attributes on the fly.

![](/img/posts/2.25/rat-ui.png)

![](/img/posts/2.25/rat-map.png)

Thanks to Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions) for the development and NOAA for sponsoring this new capability. Please see the user guide [Raster Attribute Table support](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/rat/index.html) for more information.

* [GEOS-11376](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11376) Graduate Raster Attribute Table to extension

## GeoCSS improvements

GeoCSS can now perform scale dependent rendering by the zoom level, assuming web mercator by default, but allowing the configuration of a different gridset as well. It's also possible to create multi-layer styles and use them as style groups.

```css
@mode 'Flat';
@TileMatrixSet 'WorldCRS84Quad'

tiger:poly_landmarks {

  /* @title parks and green spaces */
  [CFCC in ('D82', 'D32', 'D84', 'D85')] {
    fill: #B4DFB4;
    stroke: #88B588;
  }; 
  …
}

tiger:tiger_roads [@z > 12] {
  stroke: #666666, #FFFFFF;
  stroke-width: 6, 4;
  z-index: 1, 2;
  …
}

…
```

Thanks to Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions) for this work, performed in preparation for the FOSS4G-NA 2024 vector tiles workshop.

* [GEOS-11495](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11495) Support multi-layer output in CSS
* [GEOS-11515](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11515) Add support for zoom level rule filtering in CSS

## Geostationary satellite AUTO code

``AUTO:97004`` has been introduced as a new vendor extension to WMS AUTO codes. It implements the geostastionary satellite project and allows to change the central meridian as part of the GetMap request.

![](/img/posts/2.26/auto97004.png)

Thanks to Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions) for this work, and Eumetsat for sponsoring it.

## labelPoint function improved

The ``labelPoint`` function has been improved with more precise calculation of the polygon label points, and not requiring to specify a tolerance any longer. This helps get better maps, especially with tiling enabled (fixed labelling point no matter which tile is requested):

```xml
  <sld:TextSymbolizer>
    <sld:Geometry>
      <ogc:Function name="labelPoint">
        <ogc:PropertyName>the_geom</ogc:PropertyName>
      </ogc:Function>
    </sld:Geometry>
  </sld:TextSymbolizer>  
```

![](/img/posts/2.26/polyLabelAfter.png)

Thanks to Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions) for this work, performed in preparation for the FOSS4G-NA 2024 vector tiles workshop.

## Improved vector tiles generation

A few new vendor options have been added in GeoServer, that control how vector tiles are built, with the objective of producing smaller, faster, more useful vector tiles.

* ``vt-attributes``: comma separated list of attributes included in the vector tile
* ``vt-labels``: when true, generates a sidecar ``-label`` layer for polygons, with the label point of the polygon (vector tile clients generally cannot produce a good label placement otherewise)
* ``vt-label-attributes``:: attributes included in the label point layer
* ``vt-coalesce``: if true, takes all features in the tile sharing the same attribute values, and coalesces their geometries into a single multi-geometry.

Here is an example style using the above vendor options, in GeoCSS:

```css
@mode "Flat";

tiger:poly_landmarks {
  fill: gray;
  vt-attributes: 'CFCC,LANAME';
  vt-labels: true;
}

tiger:tiger_roads [@z > 11] {
  stroke: black;
  vt-attributes: 'NAME';
  vt-coalesce: true;
}

tiger:poi [@z > 12] {
  mark: symbol(square);
}
```

The GWC layer preview has also been improved to show the vector tile feature attributes on hover:

Thanks to Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions) for this work, performed in preparation for the FOSS4G-NA 2024 vector tiles workshop.

## GeoPackage QGIS Compatibility Improvements

A number of issues affecting interoperability with QGIS have been addressed:

GeoPackage extension output could contain field types that are not supported by GDAL.
It turns out the GeoPackage export was picking up some of the file type information intended for PostGIS
resulting output that could not be read by other programs such as QGIS.

We were also able to fix up the TIMESTAMP information representation as DATETIME, making the file format timezone agnostic as intended.

![](/img/posts/2.26/qgis-geopkg-fixes.png)

Thanks to David Blasby (GeoCat) for these fixes made on behalf of Zeeland and South Holland.

* [GEOS-11416](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11416) GeoPackage output contains invalid field types when exporting content from PostGIS

## New image mosaic merge behaviors, MIN and MAX

These two new image mosaic merge modes activate when multiple images overlap with each other, choosing respectively the minimum and maximum value amongst the super-imposed pixels.

![](/img/posts/2.26/mosaic-merge-max.png)

Thanks to Andrea Aime for the work, and the US National Research Laboratory for sponsoring it.

### OGC APIs feeling "at home"

OGC API modules now nicely slot into the home page in the corresponding functional section, e.g., since both provide raw vector data, both OGC API Features and WFS show up in the same area:

Thanks to David Blasby (GeoCat) for this work.

### Data directory loader

The "Data Directory loader", by Gabriel Roldan (Camptocamp), is a replacement data directory loader, reading the XML configuration files at startup. It has been optimized to achieve better parallelism and be more efficient over network file systems.

It can be found amongst the [nightly builds](https://build.geoserver.org/geoserver/2.26.x/community-latest/geoserver-2.26-SNAPSHOT-datadir-catalog-loader-plugin.zip), it's a simple drop in replacement, just unzip the plugin in ``WEB-INF/lib`` and restart. Let us know how it works for you.

### WFS HTML Freemarker output

The [WFS HTML Freemaker output format](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/wfs-freemarker/index.html) is a community module generating HTML in response to GetFeature, using the GetFeatureInfo Freemarker templates.

Thanks to Alessio Fabiani (GeoSolutions) for starting this activity.

### Graticule module

The [graticules module](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/graticules/index.html) is the combination of a data store and a rendering transformation allowing to generate graticules at multiple resolutions, and optionally placing the graticule labels at the map borders.

Thanks to Ian Turton for working on this activity. Ian needs a few more people to try this out before it can be included in our GeoServer roadmap.

## Developer Updates

GeoServer team has identified quite the challenges for [GeoServer 2024 Roadmap Plannings]({% post_url 2024-01-03-roadmap %}).

### Wicket Progress

After initial testing of [2.26-M0](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/releases/tag/2.26-M0) milestone release we held off including Wicket 9 until after the 2.26.0 release. Thanks to Peter Smythe and Jody Garnett for testing.

Thanks to Brad Hards who started this work in November 2023, and David Blasby who helped bring this up to a state it could be tested ahead of the 2.26.0 release.

### Spring Security 5.8

Thanks to Andreas Watermeyer (ITS Digital Solutions) completed this important update.

This is the last stopping place before Spring Security 6, and the last chance to work with the OAuth2 community modules.

* [GEOS-11271](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11271) Upgrade spring-security to 5.8
