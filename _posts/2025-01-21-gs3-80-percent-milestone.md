The [GeoServer 3 crowdfunding campaign](/sponsor/gs3-crowdfunding) has made remarkable progress, reaching 80% of its financing goal. A significant boost came from a single €100,000 pledge, underscoring the value of this essential upgrade to the GeoServer platform. With just €112,000 left to raise, now is the time to join the movement and ensure the success of this critical project.

# A Campaign with Global Outreach

This initiative, led by a consortium of 3 key companies Camptocamp, GeoCat, and GeoSolutions, has garnered backing from a wide range of contributors, including public institutions, large companies, SMEs and individuals from various countries. The campaign’s extensive outreach demonstrates GeoServer’s importance to a broad spectrum of users worldwide. GeoServer has become a cornerstone in geospatial applications across industries and borders, and this campaign reflects its far-reaching impact.

# Why GeoServer 3 Matters

The necessity of implementing GeoServer 3 has never been greater. This major upgrade will deliver:

* **Future-proof performance** to handle growing data and processing demands.  
* **Enhanced image processing** for better visualization and analysis.  
* **Improved security** to safeguard critical geospatial systems.  
* **A modernized user experience** for easier access and usability.

Without these enhancements, users and providers risk facing limitations in scalability, performance, functionality, and security. Achieving this upgrade will ensure GeoServer remains a leading tool in the geospatial industry, empowering your open-source Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) based on GeoServer to innovate continuously while providing secure, high-performance services. This will position your organization at the forefront of geospatial technology.

# A Few More Months to Make a Difference

The campaign will continue until spring, providing a limited window for additional financial contributions. While the international team of core contributors is ready to start the migration, we are waiting for the complete budget allocation to begin, in line with the rules of this crowdfunding campaign. To accommodate many entities currently finalizing their budgets, we have planned to let the campaign run for a few more months. This is an excellent opportunity for your organization to support the future of GeoServer and demonstrate your commitment to open-source geospatial solutions.

# Every Contribution Counts

With €112,000 still needed to meet the target, every pledge—big or small—matters. Whether you’re a public institution, a large company or an SME, your support can make a difference. Reaching this goal would be a remarkable achievement, building on the strong progress made so far and ensuring the future of GeoServer 3 becomes a reality.
