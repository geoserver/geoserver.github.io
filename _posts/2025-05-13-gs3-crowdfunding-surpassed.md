**Why This Matters:** GeoServer 3 represents a significant leap forward in open-source geospatial technology. With the funds raised, we will:

* **Modernize the platform** by upgrading to Spring 6 and JDK 17, ensuring long-term support and compatibility.  
* **Enhance security** through improved authentication mechanisms and compliance with current standards.  
* **Improve performance** by replacing outdated components like JAI with modern alternatives such as ImageN.  
* **Align with modern deployment environments**,  facilitating cloud-native and containerized deployments.

**Acknowledging Our Community:** This milestone was made possible by the collective efforts of individuals, organizations, and institutions worldwide. Your contributions—be it through funding, advocacy, or development—have been instrumental in shaping the future of GeoServer.

**Looking Ahead:** Surpassing our funding goal allows us to invest additional resources into further enhancements and features, as prioritized by the GeoServer Project Steering Committee (PSC). This includes a stronger focus on **security and vulnerability management**, ensuring GeoServer remains robust, secure, and resilient in the face of evolving threats. These efforts will help ensure that GeoServer continues to evolve in line with the needs of its diverse user base.

Thank you for being an integral part of this journey. Together, we've laid a robust foundation for the next generation of open-source geospatial solutions.

Stay tuned for updates as we embark on this exciting new chapter!
