## Q: How often should I upgrade GeoServer?

GeoServer operates with a time boxed release cycle, maintaining "stable" and "maintenance" releases, over the course of a year.

* Upgrade GeoServer twice a year as new stable releases are made.

* Once the release you are using has entered "maintenance" it is a good idea to upgrade (before the release is no longer supported).

* GeoServer [security policy](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/SECURITY.md) provides one year of
  support. You may also contact our [service providers](/support/) for extended support beyond this timeframe.
