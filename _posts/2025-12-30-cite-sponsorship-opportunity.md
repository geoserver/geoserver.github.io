A major accomplishment in 2025 was [re-achieving CITE Certification]({% post_url 2025-07-16-cite-certification %} ) status for GeoServer. Many thanks to all who were involved!  After approximately 10 years, we can once again officially confirm that GeoServer is OGC compliant.

Maintaining Certification is an annual expense for the project - and a sponsorship opportunity for you!

Thanks to [Gaia3D](https://gaia3d.com/) and [OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) for sponsorship covering the expense of CITE Certification for 2025.

This certification process is an annual expense of around $1000 USD, and we will require sponsorship for 2026 to maintain certified status. GeoServer implements a number of different standards, each one of which costs $150 USD to certify each year. The $150 per certification cost makes use of [an agreed on rate](https://www.ogc.org/how-our-compliance-program-works/) offered to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation as a not-for-profit organization. The approximate $1000 USD expense will increase slightly as we gradually adopt additional OGC API standards into the application.

### CITE 2026 Sponsorship Opportunity

OGC CITE Certification is important for several reasons:

* Provides assurance that GeoServer may be integrated in solutions as intended by Open Geospatial Consortium.
* Offers an independent source of black-box testing ensuring that each GeoServer release behaves as intended.
* The Provides a logo and visibility for the project helping to promote the use of open standards.
* Inclusion in the [list of certified products](https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/compliance/compliant.php) helps people discover GeoServer, and allows GeoServer to be used by organizations requiring certification.

In addition to CITE certification offering value for the project, sponsoring can provide excellent visibility
for potential sponsors, with your logo appearing on the GeoServer home page, and in presentations when each
standard is mentioned.

If you/your organization is in position to support this activity, please contact any member of [Project Steering Committee](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/developer/policies/psc.html), or the [OSGeo treasurer](mailto:treasurer@osgeo.org?subject=GeoServer 2026 CITE Sponsorship&body=We would like to sponsor the GeoServer Project 2026 CITE Certification activity.). For details visit the [GeoServer Sponsorship Page](/sponsor). The more organizations that are able to sponsor, the lower the expense will be to each organization (sharing the approx USD $1,000 per year cost).

Thank you for your support!

**In-Kind:** Thanks to following organizations for "reference implementation" certification. To act as a reference implementation GeoServer must maintain a service operating as an example of how the standard is intended to function. The Open Source Geospatial Foundation has provided hosting, and AfriGIS provided setup and maintenance.
