We are happy to announce that GeoServer 3 is approaching general availability with a target release date of **15th of April 2026**. 

This major upgrade modernises the platform’s foundation with the migration to Spring 7 and JDK 17, brings a refreshed user experience and replaces legacy image-processing components with ImageN to deliver significantly improved raster performance and maintainability. The release aligns GeoServer with current Java ecosystems, strengthens security and vulnerability management, and simplifies cloud-native deployments. You can read more about the GeoServer 3 initiative on [this](/sponsor/gs3-crowdfunding) page.

GeoServer 3 progress has been made possible by a successful community crowdfunding campaign.  This activity is possible due to financial support of sponsors listed below, and a consortium (Camptocamp, GeoCat and GeoSolutions) providing coordination and additional co-funding to move from planning into delivery.

We will publish additional announcements, along with upgrade and testing instructions in the coming weeks. The core team will ask for focused community testing on upgrade paths, high-volume raster workflows,and tiling scenarios. Final QA, packaging and documentation work is ongoing to ensure a smooth upgrade experience and clear operational guidance for administrators. 

Watch the usual GeoServer channels for the release announcement and release notes. Contact the project team if your organisation can help with final testing or needs tailored migration assistance.
