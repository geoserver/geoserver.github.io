# Announcement Generation

The announcement script is written in python:
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Write a blog post announcing the new release:
```
cd bin
python3 announcement.py username password 2.23.2 --geotools  29.2 --geowebcache 1.23.2
```

``username`` and ``password`` are your JIRA credentials.

A post is generated to standard out for your review.

* The header information should be correct, picking up your user name from git global config.

* Check the included release notes.

* Edit ``bin/templates/aboutXXX.md`` to list any new features for the about section.
  
  At the start of a new series (milestone or release candidate) a new template will be needed. You can create a new template by copying the previous example.

* Force a security vulnerability section with ``--security`` (although this will be added if any issues with component ``Vulnerability`` are included in the release)

* Announcement text based on version, use ``--override stable`` or ``--override maintenance`` if the guess was incorrect

Generate to a file using the date supplied by Jira:

```
python3 announcement.py username password 2.23.2 --geotools  29.2 --geowebcache 1.23.2 --post
```

```

## Python Virtual Environment Setup (Optional)

```
brew install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

To activate python:

### Technical Details

The python ``announcement.py`` script makes use of the Jira REST API to determine information about the release being made.

Posts are generated using Jenga2 templates located in ``bin/templates``. You can fine tune the about section for each series by adding ``aboutXXX.md`` file documenting new features.

It does check that the release is made, in order to ensure to ensure that a release date is provided.

The specific text genrated is based on checking the version number (for ``RC`` release candidate, ``M`` milestone, ``<4`` stable, or ``<7`` maintenance).

The security consideration sections is optional, with the flag including the post content and updating the header tags so the post is correctly indexed.
