    <article class="post-content">
      <p>We are pleased to announce GeoServer 1.6.0-RC1 is available for <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/1.6.0-RC1">download</a> (try <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25086&amp;package_id=38410&amp;release_id=554392">direct from sourceforge</a> if that link isn’t working).  Since beta4 the team has has closed over 60 issues, tightening up every single detail.  This is easily the most solid first release candidate that we’ve ever issued, as we are wanting to have as few release candidates as possible.  So if you have not upgraded to the 1.6.x series then now is the time to do so, to ensure that any problems that may arise get fixed as quickly as possible, before 1.6.0.</p>

<p>The 1.6.x series is a major leap forward from 1.5, with major leaps in performance, WFS 1.1 support, and the new <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/Versioning+WFS">‘versioning’ WFS</a>.  There is also much better <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/Google+Earth">support for Google Earth</a> and <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/Google+Maps">Google Maps/Virtual Earth/Yahoo! Maps</a>, leveraging better integration with <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>.  There is also a new integrated <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDEV/Geoserver+security+implementation%2C+initial+version">security subsystem</a>, built on <a href="http://www.acegisecurity.org/">Acegi</a>, to provide role-based access control to GeoServer resources.  But the real reason to upgrade to 1.6.0 is a ton of bug fixes, all the rough edges are getting sanded down, so that most all features ‘just work’, no matter what you throw at them.  So please <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/1.6.0-RC1">download</a> and let us know how it goes.</p>

      <p class="post-meta">Nov 14, 2007 • Chris Holmes</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><a href="http://topp.openplans.org">The Open Planning Project</a> is pleased to announce that they have hired long time GeoServer community member and contributor Gabriel Roldán as a software developer and solutions consultant.  He will remain based in Spain, and hopefully should help raise awareness and cooperation with other Spanish open source projects and organizations.</p>

<p>Gabriel first started on GeoServer in 2003, as one of the first outside contributors.  He did the integration of gt2wms to add WMS support to GeoServer, with a nice core rearchitecture to allow more services.  He also started the ArcSDE module and added SVG output to GeoServer.  We are very excited to have him soon working full time on GeoServer.</p>

<p>One concern in this is that TOPP developers are dominating the community, which is not desired at all.  Thankfully there are more contributors coming on all the time, indeed some were talked about in the <a href="http://blog.geoserver.org/2007/11/09/geoserver-community-happenings/">last post</a>.   But none of the new ones are yet on the Project Steering Committee, which sets the direction and makes major decisions about the future of GeoServer. It is likely that Gabriel will step down from the PSC, at least until there are enough other members that TOPP doesn’t have a majority.  Which is to say, please continue to get involved, and your hard work will be rewarded by a position on the PSC.  We want the community to truly drive this project, TOPP sees itself as a steward to help make a truly open, sustaining project that benefits all.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>One thing we’ve wanted to do with this blog is use it as a forum to allow people to follow what’s going on in the world of GeoServer without having to dive in to hundreds of messages per month on the lists.  I’ve been blogging long enough to know that I should never make promises about how often posts will come, but I will say that more of these will come in the future.</p>

<p>The most exciting things to me are a few new contributions that are becoming community modules, with their authors joining the community.  The first one to bubble up has been adding support for GeoServer to create an html image map, there were <a href="http://www.nabble.com/GeoServer-HTML-ImageMap-extension--tf4342893.html#a12371765">several</a> <a href="http://www.nabble.com/GeoServer-HTML-ImageMap-extension--tf4635290.html#a13237227">discussions</a> on the lists, with a couple different approaches developed simultaneously.  The result is that Mauro Bartolomeoli is in the process of putting his code in to a community module, there is a <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/HTMLImageMap+support">wiki page describing it</a>, and the code is currently attached to <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS-1406">the jira issue</a> tracking it.  We hope to get the code in svn and get a plugin release relatively soon.  This feature enables users to make a map with tooltips and pop-ups and the like, having it directly composed by GeoServer.  Since it is html that is returned this can scale a lot better than returning features and having pure javascript display them.</p>

<p>The other contribution in the works is some great stuff by the <a href="http://ominiverdi.org/">Ominiverde</a> team, focusing on styling and a RESTful service for SLD.  No wiki page or code yet, but they sent an email to the list <a href="http://www.nabble.com/SLD-SERVICE-RESTLET-PROPOSAL%21-tf4777451.html">describing the work</a>, with a link to a test <a href="http://test.ominiverdi.org:8080/geoserverSld/sldservice/topp:states">live service</a>.   This should be the basis of a nice thematic mapping gui based on openlayers.  The cool thing is it will leverage code from uDig, to enable all the nice work they’ve done there, but in a web environment.</p>

<p>The other thing I’ll mention here, that I think hasn’t spread very widely, is that the latest version of <a href="http://geonetwork-opensource.org/">GeoNetwork</a> includes an embedded GeoServer.  This is being used as a base map on top of which other layers can be added.  The integration is still pretty minimal, GeoServer is basically just providing a nicer base map.  But there is some work coming soon to do a tighter integration, so that users will be able to upload a shapefile or geotiff through GeoNetwork and have it automatically available through GeoServer as WMS and WFS or WCS, picking up all the service metadata properly.  Andrea Aime is currently in Rome, discussing this with developers and users at the GeoNetwork conference this week, where he also gave a workshop on GeoServer.</p>

<p>There’s much more happening, on a variety of fronts, but we’ll save it for another post.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>So it’s been way too long since we posted anything on this blog other than release announcements.  Which is not as it should be, since there’s been a ton happening in the GeoServer community.  I’m going to try to catch up with a lot of the various news in the next week or two, but wanted to just mention things here, which should force us to actually blog about them in more depth soon.</p>

<p>The first big category is the <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/">FOSS4G</a> conference.  The conference team did an amazing job, so first just want to thank them for all their hard work.  From the GeoServer perspective it was easily our best conference yet, with a number of talks from developers and users.  In coming posts I’ll highlight the talks more, with links to check them all out.  The conference is definitely the highlight of the year for those of us working on the project, because we get to meet so many excited users.  Both those that we’ve seen on the lists before, and people who have just been happily making use of GeoServer and had no reason to get in touch with us.  We also get invaluable feedback on the features users actually care about.</p>

<p>After the conference we had a successful ‘code sprint’ - most projects sprinted on Friday, but the hard-core GeoTools team followed up working through the weekend.  Thanks goes out to <a href="http://www.refractions.net">Refractions</a> for hosting us, giving us space to work away.  We worked on the biggest elephant in subversion - the new feature model that allows us to deal with complex types.  Its had many years of effort, many failed branches, and just became a scary task that seemed like it might never be done.  But Justin worked for months preparing for the sprint, where we moved almost everything to use the new way.  Initially uDig will see the results of the work first, but it was some nice implications for GeoServer - serving up set schemas from arbitrary data - when someone comes up with a bit of additional funding/time.</p>

<p>In other news we’ve been getting some great contributions of late, which I’ll write about soon.  <a href="http://topp.openplans.org">The Open Planning Project</a>, the primary maintainer of GeoServer, is also working on some exciting stuff, including mapping integration with the other main project - <a href="http://www.openplans.org">OpenPlans</a>.  The end result should be a really nice user interface for groups to make annotated maps, with full wiki-like editing, about the issues they care about.</p>

      <p class="post-meta">Oct 31, 2007 • Gabriel Roldan</p>
    </header>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>The GeoServer team is pleased to announce the availability of the latest stable release, <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.5.4">1.5.4</a>.</p>

<p>This release mostly cleans up stuff for Google Earth and Maps.  Generated maps now line up perfectly on Google Maps, with a fix to the projection code.  This allows us to replace the Google Maps overlay demo with OpenLayers, so it works with GMaps, Yahoo! Maps and Virtual Earth.  Google Earth will now zoom to the exact location of the dataset, and has further support for ‘time’ elements.</p>

<p>There are additionally a few improvements for Oracle users, including proper Shapefile output, and the ability to run in an Oracle Application Server.  Also new is Arabic rendering support and fixes for serving additional content through GeoServer.</p>

<p>Full changelog is located <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10311&amp;styleName=Html&amp;version=13609">here</a>.</p>

<p>This release is based off the brand new GeoTools 2.3.5 stable release.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the users and contributors who helped out with testing and feature suggestions, this project would not be possible without all of you.</p>
