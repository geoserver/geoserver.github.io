<h1>Project Communication</h1>
<p class="lead">
The GeoServer community utilizes multiple channels of communication. This page should help you find the channel best suited for your needs.

    <h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
    <p>
    Email is the primary form of communication for GeoServer users and developers. Being an 
    open community means that sending email to individual developers is discouraged. Instead
    all email communication should take place on one of the email lists. If you have a question
    are chances are someone else has the same question.

        <p>
            This list is for end users of the GeoServer software and focused on topics related
            to normal GeoServer usage. While it's focused mainly about GeoServer itself it is 
            also encouraged for users to post about topics around GeoServer, such as 
            implementations of projects on top of GeoServer.

    <h2>IRC</h2>
    <p>
        Many GeoServer developers hang out in the #geoserver channel on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>. This can
        be a great place to ask questions and talk directly to developers. However it is 
        intended to be a live question and answer session. Users are expected to do their 
        research before hand and ask educated questions.

    <h2>Skype</h2>
    <p>
        The most active of GeoServer developers attend a 1 hour bi-weekly Skype chat. This 
        chat is primarily for project steering committee to discuss day to day project 
        management issues but all developers who are actively engaged in GeoServer 
        development are welcome. If you wish to attend contact the developer list.
