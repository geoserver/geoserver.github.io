    <h2>Discourse Forum</h2>
    <p>
        The GeoServer User forum is hosted  on <a href="https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/geoserver/user">Discourse</a> provided by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. The forum contains all 20+ years of content from the archived SourceForge email list.</br>

    <section>
        <h3>GeoServer User Forum</h3>
        <p>
            This group is for <b>end users</b> of the GeoServer software and focused on topics 
            related to normal GeoServer usage. While its focus is mainly about GeoServer itself, users 
            are also encouraged to post about topics around GeoServer, such as 
            implementations of projects on top of GeoServer.

    <h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
    <p>
    The <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/geoserver-users">geoserver-developers</a> mailing list may later also be migrated to Discourse, but for now, it remains on SourceForge as an email list. Being an 
    open community means that sending email to an individual developer is discouraged. Instead
    all email communication should take place on the email list. If you have a question,
    chances are someone else has had the same question.
