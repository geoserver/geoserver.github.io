<h1>Issue tracker</h1>
  <p>If you have a problem when working with GeoServer, then please let us know through the Discourse user group first. Once confirmed, you can open a ticket on Jira, a bug tracking website we use to manage issue reports. 
    </p>
<section>
<h2>The issue tracker is not a support forum</h2>
<p>
If you have questions, or are having a problem please ask on the <a href="https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/geoserver/users">Discourse user group</a> first, also make sure you read the <a href="../comm/userlist-guidelines.html">guidelines</a> before posting.<br/>
It's best to open a bug report only when the issue has been confirmed by some third party, we often have to close down tickets that are created just out of a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration.

<h2>Asking for new improvements and new features</h2>
<p>
If you are looking for a new feature, or an improvement on existing functionality, we encourage you to open a ticket only after securing the necessary development resources. 
Please to read <a href="https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/Successfully-requesting-and-integrating-new-features-and-improvements-in-GeoServer">this guide to learn how to best deal with this type of requests</a>.

<h2>Access to the issue tracker</h2>
<p>
First off, make sure what you're reporting is a bug. If you have a question, a improvement/feature request, or you're unsure if you're dealing with a bug, ask on the Discourse user group instead (see above).<br/>
Also, make sure the issue is not already known by searching the bug tracker, if you find an existing ticket for the issue you can comment on it directly, instead of opening a new one.
