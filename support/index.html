<h1>GeoServer Commercial Support</h1>
<p class="lead">
    As a popular and mature project, we are pleased to see GeoServer commercial support offered by a
    range of service providers outlined below.
</p>
<p>
    Using a service provider is a great way to get started with GeoServer and important to the
    ongoing sustainability of the project. In addition to training, setup, and integration
    assistance, many service providers are in a position to report and fix issues on your behalf. This
    work directly makes GeoServer better for everyone and is vitally important.
</p>
<p>
    By choosing a service provider that helps directly as part of the leadership, or demonstrated capability to contribute as part of the team, you can help GeoServer continue to grow and thrive.
</p>
<p>
    We also wish to recognize the importance of local and regional support. If you are working with a service provider not on our list, please encourage them to contact us and take part in the GeoServer community.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Community participation:</b> Service providers tags recognize experience and community participation.
