<h1>GeoServer Commercial Support</h1>
<p class="lead">
    Being a long standing and mature project there are a number of organizations in the 
    GeoServer community that offer commercial support.
</p>

<section id="core">
    <h2>Support for Open Source</h2>
    <p>
        One inaccurate myth about Open Source is the idea that you can't get high quality
        support. The general open source way of finding support is to fully read the 
        documentation, read all the FAQ's, and then jump on irc, or post to lists or newsgroups
        . Most of the time you will actually get a faster and more helpful response than from 
        a normal commercial support center. Your questions will actually be answered by the 
        developers who write the software and users who may have encountered similar problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The common mis-perception about open source software is that the responses from lists is all you can get. That is far from the case, as there are a number of companies willing to provide commercial grade support at commercial cost. You can get a support package that is just like that which comes with any high priced software, even be able to call up a person.
    </p>
    <p>
        A variety of organizations can assist directly with installations, configurations, customizations, and telephone support. The ones found on this page have been most involved with GeoServer, and as more companies are contributing to GeoServer the network is growing. This model can be much more effective than a normal commercial 
        model since you pay directly for what you get, in an open marketplace.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Contributors</h2>
    <p>
        The organizations listed here are recognized as being closest to the core development of GeoServer, and as such are usually the best to go to for support. They are close enough to the codebase to know what is possible, and to ensure that any improvement to be made to GeoServer gets done in the right way. This can minimize your risk greatly.
